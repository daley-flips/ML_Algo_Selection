# ML_Algo_Selection

This repo displays a small amount of code I wrote while working as a Machine Learning Engineer at the 
Center for Sleep and Circadian Science.

All the data is private, but I have listed a few csv's that may help get an idea on what the real data could have looked like.

Here is a poster that Dr. Bradley Wheeler created! And we presented together at the The Center for Sleep and Circadian
Science Research Day 2024 :)
