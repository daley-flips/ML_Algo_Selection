## How is machine learning best used in sleep science?

With multi-modal data: actigraphy (watch) data, survey data, etc... 
machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for processing millions 
of data points and extracting meaningful insights.

## Which algorithm should be used?

Machine learning is roughly separable into 3 classes:
- Linear
- Non-Linear
- Deep Learning

In this project, we explore the limitations and trade-offs of each style of algorithm.



## Data Disclaimer:

All the data is private, but I have listed a few CSV files that may help get an idea 
of what the real data could have looked like.

Here is a poster that Dr. Bradley Wheeler created! We presented together at 
**The Center for Sleep and Circadian
Science Research Day 2024.** :)
